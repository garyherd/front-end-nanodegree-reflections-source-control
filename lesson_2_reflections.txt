What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it? At
initialize, a new, hidden directory called .git is created. It's needed to track
commits 
*******************

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
*******************

The working directory shows what files might be under revision. The staging area
contains the files that are tracked from the working directory, and have current
changes. The repository holds all committed changes to the files in the working
directory. Having these three areas creates a pipelined workflow, with the
staging areas offering the ability to be edited before a commit.
*******************

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
*******************

You can use git add to control what goes into staging area. For instance, if you
can changes to three files, but two of the changes should be in one commit, you
git add the two files, and then git commit will group those two files together
in a single commit. You can then go back and do another git add, git commit for
the third file.
