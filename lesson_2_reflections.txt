What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
At initialize, a new, hidden directory called .git is created. It's needed to track commits
*******************

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory shows what files might be under revision. The staging area contains the files that are tracked from the working directory, and have current changes. The repository holds all committed changes to the files in the working directory. Having these three areas creates a pipelined workflow, with the staging areas offering the ability to be edited before a commit.
