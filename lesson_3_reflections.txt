When you would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You'd create a remote repository if other people are making commits, or if you want to make commits from a machine other than your local


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you have changes in your local working directory, changes in your local staging area, or if there commits on your local that you haven't pushed to the remote before an automatic pull, there will be conflict.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone makes a copy of one repository to another location. 
A fork is a clone, but on GitHub, from one repo to your repo
A branch is done only to one repository.

The clone and fork are for making copies of whole repositories from one location to another. A branch is a local copy of a set of commits that you may want to merge with later. You would use a branch to experiment with a new feature or work on fixing a bug in your own repository. If someone wanted to fix a bug in a repository they don't own, they could do a fork.
